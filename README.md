# Stress-prediction-using-ML
Machine Learning
Developed a Python-based machine learning application for identifying stress in textual data using NLP techniques and algorithms including Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression. Conducted dataset preprocessing with TF-IDF vectorization, LIWC features, and SMOTE for class imbalance; integrated a Tkinter GUI for user input, real-time predictions, and visualizations like word clouds, confusion matrices, and probability plots to support mental health monitoring and early intervention.
